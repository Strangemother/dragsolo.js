## Getting Started

Include `dragsolo.js` in your HTML. For a plug-and-play experience, apply a selector in the script:

```html
<script src="js/dragsolo.js" dragsolo-selector='.box'></script>
```
And you're good to go!

## Manual Setup

If you're not using the `dragsolo-selector` attribute on the script tag, set up the drag host manually:

```js
const dragHost = new DragSolo();
dragHost.enable('.box');
```

Again, you're good to go!
